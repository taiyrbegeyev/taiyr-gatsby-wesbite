#### Linters vs Formatters

A great project is made out of consistent code. In the ideal world, you should not be able to tell who wrote the certain line of the code for the project. Modern linters and formatters help to close this gap by specifying a simple set of rules to be enforced on all developers working on the project. Such tools also stimulate developers to write a better code by pointing out common mistakes and introducing good programming practices.

<br/>

#### Use linters for catching errors, formatters to fix style

Linters and formatters are not interchangeable, as some of you might think. Obviously, linters can be used as formatters, but they are not the best fit for that. The reason for that is that linters have a problem with their initial design. Code linters can only deal with imperfections that have only one way of fixing them. For instance, it is considered to be a good practice to use the type-safe equality operators _===_ and _!==_ instead of their regular counterparts _==_ and _!=_.

<br/>

```js:title=Examples&nbspof&nbspincorrect&nbspcode
a == b
foo == true
bananas != 1
value == undefined
typeof foo == 'undefined'
'hello' != 'world'
0 == 0
true == true
foo == null
```

<br/>

```js:title=Examples&nbspof&nbspcorrect&nbspcode
a === b
foo === true
bananas !== 1
value === undefined
typeof foo === 'undefined'
'hello' !== 'world'
0 === 0
true === true
foo === null
```

<br/>

Let's consider a more complex example — the line length. Linters can’t reformat very long lines of code from

```js
foo(longFunction(), LongLongFunction(), reallyLongLongFunction(), peepeeLongFunction(), youGottaBeFuckingKiddingMe());
```
to
```js
foo(
  longFunction(),
  LongLongFunction(),
  reallyLongLongFunction(),
  peepeeLongFunction(),
  youGottaBeFuckingKiddingMe()
);
```

<br/>

This leads us to the conclusion that while they all have a similar purpose, they each excel in their own field. Therefore, it is helpful to benefit from both tools. Clearly, there are many different linters and formatters available out there. We'll use two popular tools to lint and format our source code: **ESLint**(preconfigured with StandardJS rules) and **Prettier** or just a unified library called **prettier-standard**.

_I would highly recommend you to use **prettier-standard**. Just read through the ESLint and Prettier sections and jump straight into the installion process of **prettier-standard**_.

<br/>

#### Linting with ESLint and StandardJS

**ESLint** is by far the best JavaScript Linter. It statically analyzes your code to quickly find problems. The primary reason ESLint was created was to allow developers to create their own linting rules. Meaning that we, developers, have a freedom of setting our own rules for the project and customizing them.

##### How does one use ESLint?

ESLint's configuration is provided within a _.eslintrc.*_ file (.eslintrc.json, .eslint.yaml) that can be used to define your own set of rules or to use plugins available for different frameworks (React, Vue, TypeScript).

Configuration files may be shared between projects. Instead of maintaining your own set of rules, you can extend another setup file. There are many widely-used configuration packages that have been published in the npm registry. These are reffered to as `eslint-config-<name>` by convention. To extend a configuration package, your create an _extends_ array in your ESLint config file, and add the name of the config package (removing the eslint-config- prefix):

```json
extends: [
  "standard" // Extend eslint-config-standard
],
rules: {
  "no-unused-vars": "error" // Your own rules
}
```

Standard is one those widely-used plugins. However, as you might have noticed, we are able to override defined rules in the shared config that we extended by creating _rules_ object. The problem with this approach is that your teammates, say, potentially could redefine rules they don't like. So that's where **StandardJS** comes in.

##### StandardJS

**StandardJS** is more that just a shareable plugin. StandardJS ships CLI that you can run directly. It comes with the same pre-configured rules, but it bundles them up into a single Command Line Program. This module saves you (and others!) time in three ways:
* No configuration. The easiest way to enforce code quality in your project. No decisions to make. No _.eslintrc_ files to manage. It just works.
* Automatically format code. Just run standard --fix and say goodbye to messy or inconsistent code.
* Catch style issues & programmer errors early. Save precious code review time by eliminating back-and-forth between reviewer & contributor.

<br/>

#### Formatting with Prettier

**Prettier** is a code formatter. It parses your code and re-prints it according to a set of opinionated formatting rules. Prettier doesn't care about the meaning of the code, only about how it looks.

Prettier can enforce consistent maximum line lengths, make sure you don't mix single and double quotes, add trailing commas to each array item, and help you with other formatting concerns.

As with the ESLint case, we also have the freedom of customizing some of the initially defined rules. Clearly, the number of options is limited in order to avoid bike-shedding. Create the config file _.prettierrc_ and add the following JSON:

```json
{
  "singleQuote": true
}
```

This will tell Prettier to prefer single quotes.

<br/>

#### Prettier-Standard

You might be wondering how to clue ESLint(or StandardJS) and Prettier together. There are two main ways to achieve it: first by manually changing config files or using library called **prettier-standard**. Prettier-Standard is formats with prettier and lints with ESLint preconfigured with standard rules. Simply install the library into your project:

```bash noLineNumbers
yarn add --dev prettier-standard
```

and you are ready to go! Everything works out of the box. You can look up all the available options/flags provided by prettier-standard here: <a href="https://github.com/sheerun/prettier-standard" target="_blank">Prettier-Standard</a>

<br/>

#### Where does this leave us?

If you’ve followed along so far, we now have two commands:
* **format**
* **lint**

When using these in practice, your best bet is to always run format first to let it try to automatically fix anything it can. Then immediately run lint to catch anything Prettier wasn’t able to fix automatically.

```json:title=package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "format": "prettier-standard --format",
    "lint": "prettier-standard --lint"
  }
}
```

<br/>
<br/>

#### What is next?

Now that we can format our code automatically, we should be able to fix our code automatically! 

Next time we're going to set up a git hook that will allow us to run before you commit. This means you're never going to have to worry about forgetting to run this again!
